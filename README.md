#README Generator

##Description
This application is an app that generates custom README files. First users are presented with prompts that ask for a title, description of the project, 
installation details, usage information, a license choice, contribution details, tests, and contact information. Once the user inputs his or her information,
A new README file is provided with the users input organized in its respective section. In addition to adding information to the license section,
the license choice displays that license's button onto the top of the page. This provides a quick and effective way to make a README file that is up to the standard
of current README files. Through the development of this app, I've been able to understand the purpose and functions of the inquirer package at a deeper level. 
In addition, this app taught me how to use and contextualize node and the terminal.
